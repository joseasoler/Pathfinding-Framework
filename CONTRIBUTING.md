Bug reports

If you encounter a bug, please follow the [How to report bugs in mods](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725234314) guide to gather as much information as possible. Providing that information in your bug report will help get your issue resolved faster.

All bug reports must provide a HugsLibs log. To obtain one, follow these steps:

1) Subscribe to [Log Publisher](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2873415404) in the Steam Workshop.
2) Inside of the game and after experiencing the issue, press Ctrl + F12. This will launch the log publisher.
3) Click on the "Upload" button.
4) Press on the "Copy" button to obtain the link to the log.
5) Paste the log link in your bug report.

If you do not have HugsLib, you can also use a RimWorld log. You can look how to obtain it in [this link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725234314).
