Ever wished your colonists could do more than just walk? Now they can! The mod introduces a variety of new movement types, allowing pawns to move across the world in entirely new ways.

Mod authors can use this framework to easily patch movement type support for their pawns, apparel, genes (with Biotech) or other items, or even define custom movement types. How to achieve all of this is described in the wiki.

Players only need to add this mod to their mod list, along with any other mods of their choice that have support for this framework. You can find a list of all known mods with Pathfinding Framework support in this collection: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3071093000

The framework is designed to play well with other mods and optimized for smooth gameplay.

Soaring above obstacles, these creatures have the skies as their domain, hovering gracefully over most landscapes.

Specialized for rapid movement beneath the surface, these creatures excel in sand and soil. On other terrains, they move similarly to their terrestrial counterparts.

[h2]Magmatic[/h2]

Born of fire and earth, these creatures roam the land and swim through molten lava with ease, yet they have an innate aversion to water.

It is also possible to define custom movement types using the framework, check the [url=https://github.com/joseasoler/Pathfinding-Framework/wiki]wiki[/url] for details.
